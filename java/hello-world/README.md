## Overview
In this module we will be going over how to implement "Hello World" in Java.

## Tutorial
First we need to make sure that we have installed Java, if you haven't done this check out the Java Installation module.
Then we will need to install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), we will be going through Eclipse and IntelliJ.
Then we can create a Java project in our IDE, we will be going over how to do this in Eclipse and in IntelliJ.

### Intalling Eclipse

### Installing IntelliJ

### Creating a Project in Eclipse
To create a project in Eclipse, follow these steps:
1. Open Eclipse and define a directory for your workspace, this can be located anywhere you want, then click "Launch".
2. Now that we have Eclipse open, click "File", then "New", then "Java Project".
    ![NewJavaProjectInEclipse](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/java/hello-world-example/000.png)
3. Once you have clicked "Java Project" you will be presented with the below screen.
    ![NewJavaProjectWindowEclipse](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/java/hello-world-example/001.png)
    Enter a name for your project in the top text box, and make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) selected.
    Once you have entered a name for your project and ensured you have a JRE click "Finish".
4. The project will now be created and appear in the left hand side of the screen under "Package Explorer".
Now we need to create a class for the project so that we have somewhere to begin writing our code.
To create a new class, expand the project by clicking the arrow to the left of the project name, then right click on the folder named "src", then hover over "New", then click "Class".
You should now see the below window.
    ![NewJavaClassWindowEclipse](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/java/hello-world-example/002.png)
5. Enter a name for your class and click "Finish".
The naming convention for classes is PascalCase, which means every new word has a capital letter at the beginning, with no spaces.
Once you have clicked "Finish" you should see the following screen.

### Creating a Project in IntelliJ
To create a Java project in IntelliJ follow these steps:
1. Open IntelliJ and click "Create New Project" on the right-hand side of the screen.
2. Make sure you have a Software Development Kit (SDK) selected at the top of the screen then click "Next".
Your SDK will be your Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that you installed in the Java Installation module.
Once you have made sure you have an SDK selected, click "Next", then "Next" again.
You should now see the following screen.
    ![NewProjectScreenIntelliJ](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/java/hello-world-example/004.png)
3. Enter a name and location for your project, then click "Finish".
Your project will now appear on the right-hand side of your screen.
4. Next, we need to create a class for our project so that we have somewhere to begin writing our code.
To create a new class, expand the project by clicking the arrow to the left of the project name, then right-click the "src" folder, then hover over "New", then click "Java Class".
You should now see the following screen.
    ![NewJavaClassPopUpIntelliJ](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/java/hello-world-example/005.png)
    
    Enter a name for your class and hit enter.
    The naming convention for classes in Java is PascalCase, which means that each new word is capitalised, with no spaces.
    Once you hit enter you should see the following screen.
    ![CreatedProjectAndClassIntelliJ](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/java/hello-world-example/006.png)

### Coding Hello World
Now that we have our project and class setup we can begin coding our application.
For our class to know what to run, we need to declare then main method in our class.

1. To declare the main method we need to add the following method within the scope of our class, the scope of the class is whatever is within the { }.
    ```Java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    }
    ```
    Now when we run our project, anything code within the main method will be executed.
2. To tell Java to print "Hello World!" to the console we will need to use the following line, which makes Java print to the console.
    ```Java
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
    ```
    If you run your code you will get the following output at the bottom of your screen in the "console".
    ![HelloWorld!OutputFromMainSystemOut](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/java/hello-world-example/007.png)
3. We can improve on this application by taking the text out of the System.out.println call and instead pass it as a variable.
To pass the text as a variable we must first define and initialise a variable with the text "Hello World!".
The variable we will be using needs to be initialised before we can use it in the System.out.println call, so it will need to go above that call in the method.
To initialise the text as the variable use the following line above the System.out.println call.
    ```Java
    String message = "Hello World!";
    ```
    Now that we have our text initialised in a variable, we can use the variable in the System.out.println call like this:
    ```Java
    System.out.println(message);
    ```
    If we run our code we will get the following output.
    ![HelloWorld!OutputWithVariable](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/java/hello-world-example/008.png)
4. We can improve on this further by moving the variable initialisation and System.out.println call into it's own method, so that it is more readable and reusable.
To do this, we will need to declare a new method, which we can name whatever we want.
Naming convention for methods is camelCase which means there are no spaces between words, the first word has no capital letters and each subsquent word has a capital letter at the beginning.
For our new method we will use the following:
    ```Java
    public static void printMessage() {
        String message = "Hello World!";
        System.out.println(message);
    }
    ```
    Then we simply need to call our new method from the main method, to do this we just need to type the name of our method followed by parentheses and a semicolon like this:
    ```Java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printMessage();
    }
    ```
    If we run this we will get the following output:
    ![HelloWorld!OutputFromSeparateMethod](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/java/hello-world-example/009.png)
5. We can once again improve on this further by having our new method take in a parameter so that the printMessage() method is even more reusable.
A parameter is a variable local to the method only, and is passed in when the method is called.
To have our new method take a parameter we will have to adjust the method declaration slightly by having a variable declared within the parentheses, like this:
    ```Java
    public static void printMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
    ```
    Since we are now passing our message in as a parameter there is no need to initialise it inside the method as this would interfere with the message we want to be printed.
    To call our method from the main method we would do the following:
    ```Java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printMessage("Hello World!");
    }
    ```
    We have to pass text into the method call so that Java knows what we want printing out to the console.
    If we run this we will get the following output:
